<p>In this screenshot, Marks of Ascension has been set to be watched for this character.  This is done on the Currency tab of the character sheet, clicking on the currency, and checking the "Show on Backpack" box.</p>
<p>After you watch or un-watch a currency, hover over the broker display to update.  It will update counts automatically when the values change.</p>
